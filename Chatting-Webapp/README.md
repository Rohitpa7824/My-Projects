#Chatting Web-App

This is a Web-App that through which two people will be able to send messages to each other.. It is not hosted yet, but it will be hosted once it is fully done.

####This web-app is being created by me and [Nilesh Kevlani](https://github.com/njkevlani)

##Bugs::
* Every new msg from second person needs to be displayed after refresh.
* The page is displayed from the Top.. not from bottom.
* Page refresh triggers extra set of messages to be entered into Database.

##Features to be added::
* Support for multiple users.

####Note :: The database creation commands will not be available here in his project. The webapp will be available when it is hosted on some platform.
